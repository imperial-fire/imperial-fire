— 🜲 My name is Elias, but I also go by any of my kintype names! I use he/any pronouns and am gender apathetic & androgynous, I am whatever you percieve me as and don't have much of a preference. I have been a wemmbu fictkin for 3 years (almost 4 now!!) and it is my main kintype :] My secondary kintype at the moment is Clownpierce, and there's a lot more that I can't be bothered to type out. Kinning is a very important thing to me and my identity, so if you're one of the people that don't support/understand it, please don't harass me about it!!

FOR PT: I prefer 15+ interactions because I don't like talking to um. little kids. , but otherwise I enjoy any and all interactions, though I am mostly offtab so be mindful if I dont respond to anything except whispers (In which case, W2I). C+H are fine with me, friend or not!! 

I am currently hyperfixated on Unstable Universe, and am also interested in LifestealSMP, Hermitcraft, VampiresSMP, Life series, Color Crew, etc . . .

I am in DESPERATE need of SMPS and servers to join. Hit me up.. Ok..?
